# /handoff — Session Handoff & Continuation

You are executing the handoff skill. This is the **only** entry point for
handoff — nothing triggers automatically. Follow these steps precisely.

## Invocation modes

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Trigger | Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `/handoff` (no args) | **manual** | Write doc + output starting prompt in chat. Do NOT launch a new session. Old session stays alive by user choice. |
| `/handoff <instructions>` | **manual + extra** | Same as manual; put `<instructions>` into the "User Instructions" section of the handoff doc. |
| `/handoff:auto` | **auto** | Write doc + output starting prompt + **auto-launch** new session via `claude` CLI after Pre-Termination Checklist passes. Old session should `/exit` after — auto mode treats the old session as a terminal event. |
| `/handoff:auto <instructions>` | **auto + extra** | Same as auto, with extra instructions embedded. |
| `/handoff auto` (legacy) | **auto** | Same as `/handoff:auto`. Accept both syntaxes. |

Default (no explicit auto): manual mode. Never auto-launch without an
explicit `:auto` / `auto` token.

**Strict parsing**: `:auto` must be either the first argument or part of
the command syntax (`/handoff:auto`). `/handoff auto` is accepted only
when `auto` is the **sole** argument or the first whitespace-delimited
token (i.e., `/handoff auto <extra>` is auto+extra, `/handoff automatic`
is **manual** with instructions "automatic"). This prevents accidental
auto-spawn from user instructions that happen to start with "auto".

**Terminal-event semantics**: "handoff is a terminal event for the old
session" only applies to **auto mode** — the old session is expected to
`/exit` immediately after spawning the new one. In **manual mode** the
skill does NOT terminate the session; the user decides whether to `/exit`,
paste the prompt into a fresh session elsewhere, or keep working. Both are
valid; the skill itself writes the doc and outputs the prompt, nothing
else.

## Step 1: Gather Context

Layer these sources (each optional):

### Layer 1: Conversation context (always available)

You have the full conversation in context. Synthesize:
- What the user was working on
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Problems encountered and solutions found
- Incomplete work and known next steps

### Layer 2: Memory search (agentic)

Search the project's auto-memory directory:
```
~/.claude/projects/<encoded_cwd>/memory/
```
Where `<encoded_cwd>` is the cwd with `:` `\` `/` replaced by `-`, leading
`-` stripped.

Glob for `*.md`. Read previous handoffs, checkpoints, project memories.

### Layer 3: Project documentation (if present)

Skim `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` at project root or parents.
Extract what's relevant to the handoff.

### Layer 4: Version control (optional)

If git is available:
```bash
git status --short 2>/dev/null
git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
```

### Layer 5: GitHub Project / Issues (best-effort — skip cleanly if unavailable)

If the project uses GitHub Issues + a GitHub Project (v2), query for next-task selection. This layer is **best-effort**: if `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or the repo has no Project, skip this layer and fall back to Layers 1–4 + `.mercury/docs/EXECUTION-PLAN.md` (or the repo's equivalent plan). Never let a Layer 5 failure block the handoff.

```bash
# Pre-flight: bail out gracefully if gh is unavailable or unauthenticated.
if ! command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 || ! gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "INFO: gh CLI unavailable — skipping Layer 5"
else
  gh issue list --label "P0" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 50 2>/dev/null || true
  gh issue list --label "P1" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 50 2>/dev/null || true

  # Project number: configurable via $HANDOFF_PROJECT_NUM. No per-repo
  # auto-fallback — the skill stays agnostic about which GitHub Project
  # belongs to which repo. Callers that want Project integration (e.g.
  # Mercury with Project #3) set the env var in their shell profile or
  # per-session before invoking /handoff.
  OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login' 2>/dev/null)
  PROJ_NUM="${HANDOFF_PROJECT_NUM:-}"

  if [ -n "$PROJ_NUM" ]; then
    gh project item-list "$PROJ_NUM" --owner "$OWNER" --format json --limit 100 2>/dev/null | \
      python -c "
import json, sys
try:
    data = json.loads(sys.stdin.read() or '{}')
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    sys.exit(0)  # gh returned empty/invalid — silently skip
items = [i for i in data.get('items', []) if i.get('status') in ('Todo', 'In Progress')]
status_order = {'In Progress': 0, 'Todo': 1}
for i in sorted(items, key=lambda x: (status_order.get(x.get('status', ''), 9), x.get('priority', 'P9'))):
    num = i.get('content', {}).get('number', '?')
    print(f'#{num} [{i.get(\"priority\",\"?\")}] {i.get(\"title\",\"?\")} ({i.get(\"status\",\"?\")})')
" 2>/dev/null || true
  else
    echo "INFO: HANDOFF_PROJECT_NUM not set — skipping Project query (set it to enable)"
  fi
fi
```

Selection criteria (in order):
1. Actively blocked P1 bugs with known root cause
2. In-Progress items from the Project board
3. Highest-priority P0 Todo from Project board
4. Next Phase sub-item per `.mercury/docs/EXECUTION-PLAN.md` (or equivalent)

Pick **one** primary task + one secondary fallback. Never produce a menu.

## Step 2: Generate Handoff Document

Write to:
```
~/.claude/projects/<encoded_cwd>/memory/session-handoff.md
```

```markdown

name: session_handoff
description: "Session handoff — <one-line summary>"

# Session Handoff — <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Starting Prompt

这是 S{N+1}。<1-line context>。

### 当前状态
<repo / branch / commit / clean or dirty>

### S{N+1} 主任务：<Issue #N — specific title>

**背景**：<1-2 lines why this is highest priority, cite Issue/Project>

**执行步骤**：
1. <actionable step with file paths / commands>
2. <actionable step>
3. <verification>
4. <commit / PR>

**次要任务（主任务完成后）**：<Issue #N or Phase X-Y, one line>

### 参考文档
<only main-task-related docs>

## Task State
- **Primary Issue**: #N [title] (status)
- **Branch**: <branch>
- **Worktree**: <path, or omit if not using a git worktree>
- **Completed**: <commits + what they did>
- **In Progress**: <current step / blockers>
- **Pending**: <remaining items>

## Key Context (compact-loss protection)
- <architecture decisions not recoverable from code>
- <gotchas / constraints>
- <important file paths + roles>

## User Instructions
<If args passed in, embed here. Else "No additional instructions.">
```

**CRITICAL RULE for Starting Prompt**: one primary task with numbered
execution steps. Never a menu of options. The next session must be able to
start executing step 1 without asking for direction.

## Step 3: Session-chain update (best-effort, optional)

Session-chain tracking is provided by the `claude-handoff` plugin (see
`github.com/392fyc/claude-handoff`). If the plugin's session_chain DB
exists, record this handoff edge:

```bash
python -c "
import os, sys
from pathlib import Path

# Plugin DB default location (claude-handoff plugin)
db_path = Path(os.environ.get('CLAUDE_HANDOFF_DB') or
                Path.home() / '.claude' / 'handoff' / 'session_chain.db')
if not db_path.exists():
    print('session_chain DB not found — skipping (plugin not installed or scaffold-only)')
    sys.exit(0)

# Defer actual writes to the plugin's session_chain package; do not duplicate
# schema logic here. If the package is importable, use it; else skip.
try:
    from session_chain import SessionChainDB
except ImportError:
    print('session_chain package not importable — skipping (scaffold not wired yet)')
    sys.exit(0)

db = SessionChainDB(db_path)
parent = os.environ.get('CLAUDE_SESSION_ID')
if not parent:
    print('CLAUDE_SESSION_ID not set — cannot record handoff edge')
    sys.exit(0)

db.record_handoff(
    chain_id=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_HANDOFF_CHAIN_ID') or parent,
    parent_session_id=parent,
    child_session_id=None,  # bound later by child session's SessionStart hook
    project_dir=os.getcwd(),
    task_ref=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_HANDOFF_TASK_REF'),
    worktree_path=os.environ.get('CLAUDE_HANDOFF_WORKTREE_PATH'),  # optional: git worktree path
)
print('session_chain edge recorded (child pending)')
"
```

**IMPORTANT**: the AGENTKB-based orchestrator path (`$AGENTKB_DIR/scripts/handoff-orchestrator.py`)
is **deprecated**. Do not call it. The replacement is the `claude-handoff`
plugin's session_chain module (above), currently a scaffold — write side
may not yet be wired at session-start.py.

## Step 4: Pre-Termination Checklist

Before launching a new session (auto mode) OR outputting the prompt (manual
mode), verify **all** in-flight work has finished. A handoff is a
**terminal event** for the old session — nothing carries over automatically.

Confirm each:

- **No pending tool calls.** All Bash / file / tool operations returned.
- **No background processes.** `run_in_background` tasks, builds, spawned
  subprocesses have completed OR the user has explicitly accepted they
  continue after handoff.
- **No unsaved state.** Edits / commits / writes are actually on disk.
- **No pending user questions.** If the old session owes a reply, answer it.

If any item is incomplete, finish or defer explicitly. Surface status:
"All pending work done — ready to hand off?"

## Step 5: Output & Dispatch

Always do **both** of these — never skip either:

1. **Output the Starting Prompt section directly in chat** — PRIMARY
   artifact. User pastes it verbatim as the first message of a new session.
2. **Save the full handoff document** to the memory path above. The auto-
   memory system will load it at next session start.

### Manual mode (`/handoff` default)

After Step 5.1 + 5.2, **stop**. Tell the user the old session stays alive;
they can copy the prompt to a new session manually or continue working in
this one. Do NOT spawn any new process.

Optional: offer to launch if the user later says so (Step 6).

### Auto mode (`/handoff:auto`)

After Step 5.1 + 5.2, and Pre-Termination Checklist passed:

**Required launch pattern — use a SHORT reference prompt, never inline the
full handoff content into the command line.** The SessionStart hook already
injects the full handoff document as `additionalContext`, so the new session
receives everything automatically. Inlining multi-line/multi-KB content
into `wt`/`tmux`/shell commands causes catastrophic failures on Windows
(multi-line expansion breaks argument parsing → error 0x80070002, multiple
ghost terminal windows).

**Short prompt construction**: compute the handoff doc path (same path
written in Step 2), then build a one-liner:

```
HANDOFF_PATH=~/.claude/projects/<encoded_cwd>/memory/session-handoff.md
SHORT_PROMPT="Continue from session handoff. The SessionStart hook injects the full document. Fallback: read ${HANDOFF_PATH}"
```

Replace `<encoded_cwd>` using the same `encode_project_path()` logic from
Step 2 (`:` `\` `/` → `-`, strip leading `-`).

#### Launch target — decide this first

Read `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`. If it is `claude-desktop`, this handoff is
running inside the Claude desktop app: open the continuation as a new desktop
session via the `claude://` deep link. Any other value (`cli`, or unset) means
a terminal session — use the terminal fallback further down.

#### Desktop app (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop`)

Build a `claude://code/new` deep link with the cwd as `folder` and the short
prompt as `q`. **Both values must be percent-encoded** — a Windows path
contains `:` and `\`, and an unencoded space or `&` truncates the link. Do not
add other query parameters. `q` is capped at 14336 characters, far above the
short prompt.

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$cwd = (Get-Location).Path
$url = "claude://code/new?folder=$([uri]::EscapeDataString($cwd))&q=$([uri]::EscapeDataString($SHORT_PROMPT))"
Start-Process $url
```

macOS: `open "$URL"` — Linux: `xdg-open "$URL"`

If only a Bash tool is available, encode with the Python the plugin already
requires, then hand the URL to the platform opener:
```bash
URL=$(python -c "import os,sys,urllib.parse as u; print('claude://code/new?folder='+u.quote(os.getcwd(),safe='')+'&q='+u.quote(sys.argv[1],safe=''))" "$SHORT_PROMPT")
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 cmd.exe /c start "" "$URL"   # Windows; use open/xdg-open elsewhere
```

**This stages the session, it does not send.** The deep link opens a new Code
composer rooted at the cwd with the short prompt already in the input box; the
user presses Enter to start it, and no session exists until they do. Tell them
that plainly rather than claiming the new session is running.

Because the new session is rooted at the same cwd, the SessionStart hook
resolves the same `<encoded_cwd>` memory path and injects the full handoff
document on that first turn — same contract as the terminal path.

#### Terminal fallback (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is not `claude-desktop`)

**Optional flag propagation**: if `CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO_LAUNCH_FLAGS` is set
in the user's environment (e.g. via `~/.claude/settings.json` env block),
its contents are injected into the launch command between `claude` and the
`--` sentinel. This lets users propagate per-session flags like
`--channels server:my-channel --dangerously-load-development-channels` to
auto-spawned sessions without editing this skill. When the env var is
unset, expansion is empty and the command behaves as before.

Use the `${CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO_LAUNCH_FLAGS:-}` form so an unset variable
expands to nothing rather than a literal `${...}`.

**Windows** (Windows Terminal, new tab):
```bash
wt -w 0 nt --title "Handoff" -d "<cwd>" -- claude ${CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO_LAUNCH_FLAGS:-} -- "$SHORT_PROMPT"
```

**macOS / Linux with tmux** (real new window, detached from current TTY):
```bash
tmux new-window -n handoff "claude ${CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO_LAUNCH_FLAGS:-} -- '$SHORT_PROMPT'"
```

**macOS / Linux without tmux** — there is no portable "new terminal"
primitive. Use `tmux new-session -d` or the terminal emulator's own CLI
(e.g. `osascript -e 'tell app "Terminal" to do script ...'` on macOS,
`gnome-terminal --` on Linux). Otherwise fall back to manual mode.

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s handoff "claude ${CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO_LAUNCH_FLAGS:-} -- '$SHORT_PROMPT'"
```

The positional argument after `--` is the session's first user message —
documented at <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference>. The `--`
sentinel ensures a prompt beginning with `-` is not parsed as a CLI option
(<https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3844>). The
SessionStart hook will inject the full handoff document as
`additionalContext`, so the new session has everything — the short prompt
is a bootstrap trigger, not the content carrier.

Once the continuation is launched (terminal) or staged (desktop), do NOT
continue producing output in the old session — its job is done. Advise the
user to `/exit` (or close the tab) once they have confirmed the new session is
actually running: on the desktop path that means after they press Enter in the
new composer, not merely after the deep link opens.

## Step 6: Post-Dispatch (manual mode only, optional)

If the user returns after manual mode and says "launch it now", re-enter
the auto path from Step 5 (auto mode).

## Rules

- Starting Prompt must be **self-contained** — zero context assumed in the
  new session.
- Include specific file paths, line numbers, commands.
- Never include secrets, API keys, credentials.
- The chat-output prompt is the PRIMARY deliverable — never skip it.
- Do NOT add automatic hooks for SessionEnd or PreCompact — handoff is
  **explicit only**.
- **Mode-scoped termination**: auto mode treats handoff as a terminal
  event for the old session (spawn new → /exit old). Manual mode does
  NOT terminate; the user decides. Never apply auto-mode termination to
  a manual invocation.
- Before terminating (auto mode) verify all pending work has completed.
  Nothing carries over automatically.
- Manual mode MUST NOT spawn processes or open `claude://` deep links. Only
  the `:auto` (or legacy `auto`) token triggers a launch, terminal or desktop.
- The legacy `$AGENTKB_DIR/scripts/handoff-orchestrator.py` path is
  DEPRECATED. Do not invoke it. The `claude-handoff` plugin is the
  canonical session-continuity module
  (<https://github.com/392fyc/claude-handoff>).
