# claude-handoff

Session handoff & auto-continuation for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

When a working session approaches its context limit, `/handoff` generates a structured handoff document, launches a fresh session, and the new session picks up exactly where the old one left off — no copy-paste, no context loss.

## What It Does

1. You invoke `/handoff` in a session that is about to end (context full, long-running task needs continuation, end of day).
2. The skill synthesizes the conversation into a **self-contained Starting Prompt** and saves it as a handoff document in Claude's auto-memory.
3. Optionally launches a new terminal tab running `claude` with the Starting Prompt as its first message.
4. A SessionStart hook in the new session reads the handoff document and injects it as additional context — the new session begins working immediately.
5. The old session terminates; context has been transferred.

## Design Principles

- **Explicit only.** Handoff runs when you type `/handoff`. No automatic triggers on SessionEnd, PreCompact, or anywhere else.
- **Terminal event.** Handoff is for ending a session, not pausing it. The old session's job ends when the new one launches — but only after all its pending work (tool calls, background processes, unsaved state) has completed.
- **Layered context.** The skill gathers context from conversation → memory → project docs → VCS (optional), degrading gracefully when any layer is unavailable. No git-only assumptions.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Python stdlib only. If `python` runs, the plugin runs.

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add 392fyc/claude-handoff

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install claude-handoff@claude-handoff

# Restart Claude Code for hooks/skills to load
```

### From a local clone (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/392fyc/claude-handoff.git
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-handoff
claude plugin install claude-handoff@claude-handoff --scope local
```

### Update after pulling changes

```bash
claude plugin update claude-handoff@claude-handoff
# Then restart the session — plugin cache has version delay
```

## Usage

In any Claude Code session:

```
/handoff
```

The skill will:
1. Build a handoff document from conversation context, memory, and project docs
2. Write it to `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/session-handoff.md`
3. Print the Starting Prompt in the chat so you can paste it manually if preferred
4. Ask whether to launch the next session automatically

After the new session starts, exit the old one (`/exit` or close the terminal).

### Where the new session opens

`/handoff:auto` reads `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` and picks its target:

- **`claude-desktop`** — opens a `claude://code/new?folder=…&q=…` deep link, giving you a new session in the Claude desktop app rooted at the same folder with the starting prompt already in the composer. It stages the session; press Enter to start it.
- **anything else** — the original terminal launch (`wt` on Windows, `tmux` on macOS/Linux).

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- Python 3.8+ (stdlib only; no pip installs required)
- For auto-launch from the Claude desktop app: nothing extra — the app registers the `claude://` URL scheme itself
- For auto-launch from a terminal session: Windows Terminal (`wt`) on Windows, or any terminal that can background `claude` on macOS/Linux

## How It Works

### SessionStart hook (`hooks/session-start.py`)

On every new session, the hook checks `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/session-handoff.md`. If present and non-empty, it outputs the contents wrapped in a `<session-handoff>` tag via the `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` channel. Claude Code then injects that into the new session's first turn.

### `/handoff` skill

The skill prompt (see `skills/handoff/SKILL.md`) instructs Claude how to:
- Gather layered context (conversation, memory, docs, optional VCS)
- Compose a self-contained Starting Prompt
- Write the handoff document
- Output the prompt to chat AND launch a new session

### Data paths

- `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` — hook logs (`poc.log`) live here (~/.claude/plugins/data/claude-handoff-\<marketplace\>/)
- `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/` — handoff documents (managed by Claude Code's auto-memory)

Path encoding: replace `:`, `\`, `/` in cwd with `-`, strip leading `-`. E.g. `D:\Work\Project` → `D--Work-Project`.
